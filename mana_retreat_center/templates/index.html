    <button class="accordion">What is different about Mana House?</button>
        <div class="panel">
              <p>More than just your shared home with housemates, Coliving is for people who share intention, values, and interests. To steal from Guy Perdix's article on coliving: "We want to help people on their journey of transition. Help them fulfil their intention in search for alignment. Not telling them who they should be or how they should get there, but giving them the tools, resources, community, and necessary confrontation to build a life journey that is aligned with who they truly are at their core." Well said, Guy â€“ that is what we're creating, and we'd love it if you would join us.

    <button class="accordion">I keep to myself, is Mana House for me?</button>
        <div class="panel">
              <p>While we don't expect you to be "on" every minute of every day, a certain level of group participation is what we're going for. I (Charlie) am an introvert, and I look forward to our weekly dinner and mastermind group; other times, I may disappear for a few days for deep work or to recharge.

    <button class="accordion">What's the Round Rock neighborhood like?</button>
        <div class="panel">
              <p>Very nice, safe, clean neighborhood. Bike required for local shops access (1 mile). Car recommended.

        </div>
    <button class="accordion">What are the meals like?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>We have a group dinner every Friday evening at 5-6 pm. This could range from a gourmet garlic curry dish on top of chicken breasts, to pizza that we order from the local shop.
